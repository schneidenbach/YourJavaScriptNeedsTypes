# Your JavaScript Needs Types

---

America, we need to have a talk
(american flag here)
not talking about why you're still writing VB6 sometimes or whatever
We need to have a conversation about the web

the web is more than the webforms apps we've been writing for a while and more than MVC, Rails, Django, whatever it is you use
Of course we;re talking about JAVASCRIPT



---

JAVASCRIPT IS WEIRD.

---

```javascript
var customer = repo.getCustomer(id);
var orders = customer.getOrders();
```

---

```javascript
var customer = repo.getCustomer(id);
var orders = customer.getOrder<span style="text-color: red">e</span>s();
```

---

```javascript
var customer = repo.getCustomer(id);
var orders = customer.<span style="text-color: red">getHorDoeuvres</span>();
```

---

`this`

---

```javascript
window.WhoAmI = "I'm the window object";

function Test() {
  this.WhoAmI = "I'm the Test object";
}

var t = Test();
alert(window.WhoAmI);   // I'm the Test object
alert(t.WhoAmI);        // t is undefined
```

---

```javascript
window.WhoAmI = "I'm the window object";

function Test() {
  this.WhoAmI = "I'm the Test object";
}

var t = <span style="text-color: red">new</span> Test();
alert(window.WhoAmI);   // I'm the window object
alert(t.WhoAmI);        // I'm the Test object
```

---

###  `typeof`

Code | Returns
---- | ------
`typeof undefined` | `"undefined"`
`typeof null` | `"object"`

---

![undefined is not a function](assets/undefined.png)

---

JAVASCRIPT IS WEIRD.

---

So how can we make the weird less weird?

---

Number one thing you can do:

---

Number one thing you can do:<br>
understand JavaScript
---

Number one thing you can do:<br>
understand JavaScript<br>

THIS IS HARD.

---

Number two thing you can do:

---

Number two thing you can do:<br>
use a type system

---

Type Systems

---

Type systems are all about adding certainty

---

Type systems are all about adding certainty
(As .NET folks we can definitely understand this)

---

Type systems are all about adding certainty  
(As .NET folks we can definitely understand this)  

(...unless we use VB.NET with Option Strict Off)

---

Advantages of type systems

1. Safety
2. Tooling
3. Self-documenting code

## But don't take my word for it

## Reddit
Wanted a language with a type system
> Types **serve as documentation at the micro-level**, help ensure correctness (to a certain degree), and most importantly, make refactoring code less stressful.

### For example

```typescript
interface Person {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    age?: number;
}
```

## Reddit
> **Another consideration was the speed of development.** We wanted to add types because we wanted to move quickly. This sounds a bit antithetical to how many people view types, in that it adds overhead to development and therefore slows developers down. **However, in moving quickly, it is much easier to introduce bugs.**

## The result?

> Using a typed language in our frontend has already paid dividends: our **code has fewer type-related bugs**, we are more confident making large refactors, and our inline documentation is focused around concepts instead of object shapes and function parameters.

## How about Slack?

> First, we were **surprised by the number of small bugs we found when converting our code**. Talking to other developers who began using a type checker, we were delighted to hear that this was a common experience: **the more lines of code a human writes**, the more inevitable it becomes to misspell a property, assume the parent of a nested object to always exist, or to use a non-standard error object.

## Slack

> Second, we **underestimated how powerful the editor integration is**. Thanks to TypeScriptâ€™s language service, editors with an autocomplete function can support the development with context-aware suggestions. **TypeScript understands which properties and methods are available on certain objects, enabling your editor to do the same.** An autocomplete system that only uses words in the current document feels barbaric afterward.

###  Union types

```typescript
interface AjaxOptions {
    url: string;
    type: string;
}

function ajaxRequest(urlOrOptions: string | AjaxOptions) {}
```

---

###  Union types

```typescript
interface AjaxOptions {
    url: string;
    type: string;
}

function ajaxRequest(urlOrOptions: string | AjaxOptions) {
    if (typeof urlOrOptions === "string") {
        return $.get(urlOrOptions);
    } else {
        return $.ajax(urlOrOptions.url, {
            type: urlOrOptions.type
        });
    }
}

```

## Advantages of type systems

1. Safety
2. Tooling
3. Self-documenting code

---

## Examples of safety:
- Variable declaration
- Interfaces
- Generics
- Either-or (union) types
- Combining (intersection) types

---

###  Implicit Types

Variables and functions will be given types where possible

```typescript
let aNumber = 42;   //aNumber is inferred to be type 'number'
```

If you mix types, TypeScript/Flow will show an error

```typescript
let aNumber = 42;
aNumber = "forty two";  //Error: aNumber is of type number
```

---

###  Interfaces define structure

The "shape" of the object is what counts

```typescript
interface Person {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
}

function addPerson(newPerson: Person) {
    //do some stuff
}

addPerson({
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Lackey"
});     //totally valid

```

---

###  Generics

Allows you to define reusable constraints on types

```typescript
let thePersons: Array<Person> = [];

thePersons.push({
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Lackey"
});

thePersons.push("John Lackey");     //error

```

---

### Intersection types

```typescript
interface Dog { breed: string; }
interface Dinosaur { hasSharpTeeth: boolean; }

let dog: Dog = { breed: "Poodle" };
let velociraptor: Dinosaur = { hasSharpTeeth: true };

let abomination = extend({}, dog, velociraptor);

console.log(abomination.breed);         //valid!
console.log(abomination.hasSharpTeeth); //valid!
```

## Tooling

* Intellisense
* Squigglies
* Refactoring

Let's take you through some of the things you get

1. Safety
2. Tooling
3. Self-documenting code
4. Sometimes, advanced language features (if you use TypeScript)





Ok, so you're using a type system.  Which one?

Flow
Is a checker, not a language
You need to remove the type annotations using some kind of build step - babel is a good example
Better type inference

(example of a function that returns number or undefined)

TypeScript
extreme community support
tooling great
Has modern language features
More turnkey for .NET folks


Let's take you through some of the challenges

Does your javascript need types if you're doing a small project? probably not
Does your javascript need types if you're adding an animation to a WebForms page stuck in a script tag? no
Is the JS code base large?
Do you need to refactor often?

Confession: the talk is named your javascript needs types, but yeah that's a lie
1. Yet Another Language to Learn
2. Altered Workflow
3. You aren't taking advantage of JavaScript's best part: it pretend like it's gonna work (just kidding)
